% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )


% correct bad hyphenation here

%\boldmath
 We propose \textit{DynaML}, a flexible and modular \textit{Scala} based library for the implementing and tuning large scale supervised kernel based models. The framework consists of a set of modules for (gradient and gradient free) optimization, model representation, kernel functions, evaluation and probabilistic graphical models.
 
 A kernel based \emph{Fixed-Size Least Squares Support Vector Machine} (FS-LSSVM) model is implemented using the proposed framework, while heavily leveraging the parallel computing capabilities of \textit{Apache Spark}. Global optimization routines like \emph{Coupled Simulated Annealing} (CSA) and \emph{Grid Search} are implemented in the optimization module and are used to tune the hyper-parameters of the FS-LSSVM model. Finally, we carry out experiments on standard data sets like \emph{Magic Gamma}, \emph{Ripley}, \emph{Forest Cover}, \emph{Susy} etc. and evaluate the performance of various kernel in combination with LSSVMs.

\section{Introduction} \label{introduction}
The $21^{st}$ century stands out in how mankind learned the value of storing and making predictions/decisions from large volumes of data. A significant aspect of large scale data analysis is distributed computation frameworks like \textit{High Performance Computing}, \textit{Message Passing Interface} etc. Recently large scale commodity hardware clusters have replaced the two former frameworks as the most popular model for parallel data analysis. With this crucial change in hardware came a change in computational models as well. It is at this juncture that distributed \textit{Map Reduce} became the de-facto computational philosophy for large scale data analysis and  words such as \textit{Hadoop} \cite{Hadoop:2005}, \cite{chang2008bigtable}, \cite{Borthakur2011} and \textit{Apache Spark} \cite{Zaharia2010}, \cite{Spark:2010} have become synonymous with large scale data analysis and machine learning.

Along with innovation in hardware design and distributed computing models, there came a need for good programming libraries and frameworks to work with various Machine Learning models on large data sets. It was demonstrated in \cite{10.1109/MIS.2009.36} that a gigantic language corpus encapsulates almost all aspects of human language and speech. So far the prevalent `motto' in the Internet industry has been ``large data, simple models", which is a mis-understood phrase as it can be confused as a statement of \textit{Occam's Razor}. The decomposition of the generalization error in Machine Learning is the well known ``bias-variance" trade-off \cite{Valentini2004}, from that it can be observed that there is an optimal point between the bias and variance of a model such that the generalization error is minimum.

Therefore, in order to extract maximum value from large scale data, it is imperative to have the flexibility to train and compare different model families before arriving at the one that fits the requirement of the user. This is not possible in a rigid, monolithic programming framework. Modularity, extensibility and ease of usage are of paramount importance while designing Machine Learning software for large scale data applications. In the sections that follow, we review the \textit{Fixed-Size Least Squares Support Vector Machine} (FS-LSSVM) algorithm as outlined by the authors in \cite{DeBrabanter2010} and give an introduction to \textit{DynaML} and its component modules.

\section*{DynaML}
Our library tackles three major issues w.r.t. the design of a Machine Learning research toolkit.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Modularity}:
It is imperative in data science to tweak models by changing the various components which they employ to learn, for example a model may be linear or kernel based, it can be optimized by various methods like \textit{Stochastic Gradient Descent}, \textit{Conjugate Gradient}, etc, there may be a mechanism of model selection or hyper-parameter optimization. Keeping the source code modular enables quick development and tuning of advanced models which build on a set of common building blocks.
\item \textbf{Flexibility of Abstraction}:
Learning models employ various mathematical structures; graphs, vectors, matrices etc. They also have a hierarchy which defines their parameters, objective functions and by extension their behavior. By representing learning models based on a abstract class hierarchy, our library leverages \textit{Object Oriented Programming} to create a powerful and reusable code base.
\item \textbf{Distributed Computing/Database Support}:
The big data landscape has many tools which enable the storage and analysis of large streams of data, they consist of technologies such as, but not limited to \textit{Apache Spark}, \textit{Hadoop}, Graph Databases like \textit{Titan} \cite{Titan:2014}, \textit{OrientDB} \cite{OrientDB:2010}, \textit{Neo4j} \cite{Neo4j:2010}. Creating a powerful framework for model training and evaluation requires the decoupling of storage and processing infrastructure from the actual logic that implements the architecture of learning models.
\end{itemize}

In the following section we introduce the FS-LSSVM algorithm\cite{DeBrabanter2010}. Section \ref{archi} outlines the various modules that comprise DynaML and their roles. An implementation of the FS-LSSVM model is constructed using the framework and tested on various data sets, with the findings outlined in \ref{exp}. Finally, we conclude in Section \ref{Conclusion}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Least Squares Support Vector Machines}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Formulation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%5
Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LSSVM) \cite{lssvmbook} \cite{Suykens1999} introduces in the SVM formulation the \textit{squared error} loss function and equality constraints with respect to the slack variables $e_i$, as shown in equation \ref{eqlssvm}. 
\begin{equation}\label{eqlssvm}
\begin{aligned}
& \underset{w,b,e}{\text{min}}
& & \mathcal{J}(w,e) = \frac{1}{2}w^{\intercal}w + \frac{\gamma}{2}\sum\limits_{i=1}^N e_{i}^2 \\
& \text{s.t.}
& & y_{i}[ w^{\intercal}\phi(x_{i})+b ] = 1 - e_{i}, i=1,\ldots ,N.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Introducing the Lagrangian and applying the KKT conditions gives us the solution of the problem in the dual (eq. \ref{eqkkt}). This solution implies a loss of sparsity as compared to the classical SVM since each point becomes a support vector. However, we gain linearity of the solution (i.e. we do not have to solve the \textit{Quadratic Programming} problem as in the classical SVM). Solving the problem in the dual is not advantageous for large scale analysis as the size of the solution matrix is equal to the size of the original data.  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqkkt}
\left[\begin{array}{c|c}
   0  & y^T   \\ \hline
   y & \Omega + \gamma^{-1} \mathit{I} 
\end{array}\right] 
\left[\begin{array}{c}
   b    \\ \hline
   \alpha  
\end{array}\right] = \left[\begin{array}{c}
   0    \\ \hline
   1_v  
\end{array}\right] 
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%5
\begin{align*}
\mathit{where} \ \Omega_{kl} &= y_{k}y_{l}K(x_{k}, x_{l}) \\
\alpha &= \left[\alpha_1 ; ... ; \alpha_N \right]
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{FS-LSSVM}
In order to make the training of kernel based SVM models for large scale data applications feasible, one needs to make approximations to the computation of the kernel matrices. The Fixed-Size LSSVM (FS-LSSVM) as proposed by De Brabanter, Suykens et. al \cite{DeBrabanter2010} consists of solving the LSSVM problem in the primal as follows.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqfs}
min_{w,b} \ \frac{1}{2}w^{\intercal} w + \frac{\gamma}{2}\sum^{n}_{i=1} \|(y_{i} - w^{\intercal} \hat{\phi}(x_i) - b\|_{2} 
\end{equation}

The solution to equation \ref{eqfs} is given by:
\begin{align*}
\label{eqfssol}
& \left( \begin{matrix}
\hat{w}\\ 
\hat{b}
\end{matrix}\right ) = 
\left ( \hat{\Phi}^{\intercal}_e \hat{\Phi}_e + \frac{\mathit{I}_{m+1}}{\gamma} \right )^{-1} \hat{\Phi}^{\intercal}_e y
\\ \\
& \hat{\Phi}_e = \begin{pmatrix}
\hat{\phi}_{1}(x_1) & \cdots & \hat{\phi}_{m}(x_1) & 1\\ 
\vdots &  \ddots & \vdots & \vdots\\ 
\hat{\phi}_{1}(x_n) & \cdots & \hat{\phi}_{m}(x_n) & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}

In the above formulation, $\hat{\phi}(x_k)$ is an approximation to the true feature map $\phi(x_k)$ which is related to the kernel $K(x_i, x_j) = \phi(x_i)^{\intercal} \phi(x_j)$ (Mercer's theorem). The approximate feature map $\hat{\phi}(x_k)$ is calculated using the Nystr$\ddot{o}$m method as outlined in \cite{DeBrabanter2010,Mall2015} and \cite{Mall2013}. A low rank approximation to the kernel matrix is constructed by iteratively calculating a subset of the original data which maximizes the \textit{Quadratic R\`enyi Entropy}. This procedure of extracting $\hat{\phi}(x_k)$ from a data set, given a kernel function, is called \textit{Automatic Feature Extraction} (AFE).

Kernel based models suffer from sensitivity to hyper-parameters. In the case of FS-LSSVM we have to tune the model with respect to $\gamma$ the regularization parameter and the parameters of the kernel chosen. Models are generally compared with their cross-validation performance in which case the objective cost function with respect to the hyper-parameters is in general non-smooth and non-convex. Gradient free methods like Grid Search, Nelder Mead \cite{Nelder1965} and Coupled Simulated Annealing \cite{Xavier-De-Souza2010} are suitable to tackle the problem of model selection for FS-LSSVM based kernel models.

\section{Architecture} \label{archi}

Figure \ref{fig:struct} shows the organization of modules in DynaML. It can be decomposed into five principal modules.
\begin{itemize}
\item Model Classes:
This is the core set of classes which form the heart of the library, a number of abstract model categories are defined each with its own set of defined behaviours. 
\item Optimization API:
A module which houses the implementation of common optimization methods (i.e. Gradient and Gradient free). Currently DynaML has implementations for Conjugate Gradient, Gradient Descent, Grid Search and Coupled Simulated Annealing \cite{Xavier-De-Souza2010}. 
\item Kernels:
DynaML is equipped with a powerful abstract API for representing kernel functions. The module has two abstract classes to outline the behaviors of kernels used in SVM based applications as well as density estimation. The library comes bundled with an implementation for AFE as well as for common SVM kernels i.e. RBF, Polynomial, Laplace, Exponential. New kernel functions can be easily added to the library by extending the base classes in this module.

\item Miscellaneous Utilities:
This module contains code to carry out auxiliary tasks for model learning and optimization. It contains the implementation of entropy calculation, summary statistics, prototype selection as well as a set of various functions which can be required for implementing new model classes using the library.  

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Class Hierarchy}

Figures \ref{fig:modelUML} and \ref{fig:modelUML1} depict the class hierarchy structures of the core and optimization modules respectively, we can discuss their role in depth.

\subsubsection*{Core Components}
The core module consists of a set of classes which all originate from a base abstraction called \textit{Model}. It also has classes \textit{ParameterizedLearner} and \textit{LinearModel} representing the core behaviors of parameter based Machine Learning models which form a large chunk of current learning techniques. By using generic typing inherent in the Scala language, one is able to separate the logic of a model from the details of the underlying data infrastructure. This is particularly relevant due to the explosion of data processing frameworks and systems like graph databases, Apache Spark, key value stores, column oriented databases, etc.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{adjustbox}{max width=0.5\textwidth}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{interface}[text width =3 cm]{Model}{0 ,0}
        \attribute { g : G }
    \end{interface}
    
    \begin{interface}[]{ParameterizedLearner}{ 0 , -3}
        \implement{Model}
        \attribute{params : Q}
        \attribute{optimizer : RegularizedOptimizer}
        \operation{learn() }
    \end{interface}
    
    \begin{interface}[]{EvaluableModel}{ 6 , 0}
        \operation{evaluate(config: Map[String, String]) }
    \end{interface}
    
    \begin{abstractclass}[text width =3 cm]{LinearModel}{6 , -3}
        \implement{ParameterizedLearner}
        \implement{EvaluableModel}
        \operation{predict(point) }
        \operation{clearParameters() }
    \end{abstractclass}
    
    \begin{interface}[]{GloballyOptimizable}{ 6 , -6}
        \attribute{hyper\_parameters: List[String]}
        \attribute{current\_state: Map[String, Double]}
        \operation{energy(h: Map[String, Double], options: Map[String, String]) }
    \end{interface}
    
    \begin{abstractclass}[]{KernelizedModel}{0 , -6}
        \inherit{LinearModel}
        \implement{GloballyOptimizable}
        \attribute{nPoints: Long}
        \attribute{prototypes: List[Long]}
        \operation{featureMap(point: Q)}
        \operation{applyKernel(kernel: SVMKernel) }
        \operation{crossvalidate(folds: Int, reg: Double)}
        \operation{applyFeatureMap()}
    \end{abstractclass}
    
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{adjustbox}
\caption{Class Hierarchy of Models}
\label{fig:modelUML}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Kernel Functions and Kernel Based Models}
The kernel module contains implementations of SVM kernels and AFE. The class \textit{KernelizedModel} defines kernel based linear models which use the \textit{GlobalOptimizer} class to tune values of hyper-parameters. The actual implementation of the \textit{Automatic Feature Extraction} is abstracted out in the parent classes, thereby reducing the effort of writing new SVM kernels to merely expressing their evaluation functions.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{adjustbox}{max width=0.5\textwidth}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{interface}[]{Optimizer}{0 ,0}
        \operation{optimize(nPoints: Long, data: S, initialParams: P)}

        \attribute{step: Double}
        \attribute{gridsize: Double}
        \attribute{logScale: Boolean}
    \end{class}
    
    \begin{class}[]{CoupledSimulatedAnnealing}{6 , -9}
        \inherit{GridSearch}
        \attribute{numIterations: Double}
        \operation{acceptance(energy: Double, coupling: Double, temperature: Double)}
        \operation{mutate(config: Map[String, Double], temperature: Double)}
        \operation{acceptanceTemperature(t: Double)(k: Int)}
        \operation{mutationTemperature(t: Double)(k: Int)}
    \end{class}
    
    
    
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{adjustbox}
\caption{Class Hierarchy of Optimization API}
\label{fig:modelUML1}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Optimization Methods}
Parametric models in DynaML have an embedded optimization object which is inherits from the \textit{Optimizer} interface. Implementations of Conjugate Gradient and Gradient Descent are provided in the optimization module. New optimization algorithms can be added by inheriting from the top level \textit{Optimizer} interface or the \textit{RegularizedOptimizer} abstract class in case one is working with parametric models which involve regularization. Another important component of the optimization module is the \textit{GlobalOptimizer} interface which acts as a skeleton for implementing gradient free global optimization algorithms.

\section{FS-LSSVM Implementation} \label{fsimpl}
The implementation of the FS-LSSVM in DynaML, outlined in algorithm \ref{lssvmalgo} is as described in the original article of Brabanter et.al \cite{DeBrabanter2010}. Kernel based models all implement the interface \textit{GloballyOptimizable} in the optimization module. Since the \textit{GlobalOptimizer} and its subclasses (i.e. \textit{GridSearch} and \textit{CoupledSimulated Annealing}) all optimize models which implement the \text{GloballyOptimizable} interface, it enables tuning of models with a variety of global optimization algorithms convenient.

\begin{algorithm} \label{lssvmalgo}
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Data Set, Kernel, Global Optimization routine, grid parameters}
\KwResult{Tuned FS-LSSVM model}

 sampling and Quadratic Renyi Entropy.\;

 \While{termination of global optimization routine}{
  Initialize the kernel using the hyper-parameters.
  Do AFE on the kernel matrix constructed from the prototypes, using the Nystrom method\;
  evaluate the cross validation score for the particular hyper-parameter values\;
 }
 \caption{Tuning FS-LSSVM}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Experiments} \label{exp}

The experiments are performed on a 40 core 64GB RAM machine at the Department of Electrical Engineering, KU Leuven. The performance of binary FS-LSSVM classifiers on the \textit{MAGIC Gamma} Telescope Data Set obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, are summarized in table \ref{table1}. It is observed that tuning kernel models with CSA gives better results than linear FS-LSSVM models tuned on only the regularization parameter. FS-LSSVM models trained with polynomial kernels give better classification performance than the RBF and Linear counterparts, on the \textit{MAGIC Gamma} data.

\section{Conclusion} \label{Conclusion}

In this paper, \textit{DynaML}, a new Scala based Machine Learning library was proposed, suitable for research and development of advanced Machine Learning models. As a use case, the kernel based FS-LSSVM model is implemented by extending the \textit{DynaML} class hierarchy, and tested on benchmark data sets. We observed that our library enables scalable implementation, tuning and evaluation of models of high complexity, while still providing flexibility to tweak various underlying data processing infrastructure.
